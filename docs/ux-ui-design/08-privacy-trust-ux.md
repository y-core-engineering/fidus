## Overview

This document defines how privacy and trust manifest in Fidus's user experience. Privacy is NOT hidden in settings - it's an active, visible part of every interaction.

## Privacy Indicators

### Processing Location Badges

**Every LLM response shows WHERE it was processed:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    Response[LLM Response] --> Badge{Processing<br/>Badge}

    Badge --> Local[🔒 Processed Locally<br/>Green badge]
    Badge --> Cloud[☁️ Processed via Cloud<br/>Orange badge]
    Badge --> Encrypted[🔐 Encrypted at Rest<br/>Blue badge]

    style Local fill:#2E7D32,color:#ffffff
    style Cloud fill:#F57C00,color:#fff
    style Encrypted fill:#1976D2,color:#fff
```

### Badge Variants

**Local Processing (Default):**

```
+--------------------------------+
| Fidus              🔒 Local    |
|                                |
| You have 2 meetings today:     |
| • 10:00 AM - Team Standup      |
| • 3:00 PM - Client Review      |
+--------------------------------+

🔒 Local = Ollama LLM on your device
```

---

**Cloud Processing (Fallback):**

```
+--------------------------------+
| Fidus              ☁️ OpenAI   |
| [Why?]                         |  ← Tap to see explanation
|                                |
| Your budgets are on track:     |
| • Food: 60% (300/500 EUR)      |
| • Transport: 45% (135/300)     |
+--------------------------------+

☁️ OpenAI = Processed via cloud LLM
```

**Tap "Why?" → Explanation Modal:**

```
+------------------------------------------+
| Why Cloud Processing?        🔒 Local ✕  |
+------------------------------------------+
| Your query was processed via OpenAI      |
| instead of locally.                      |
|                                          |
| Reason:                                  |
| • Local LLM (Ollama) is offline          |
| • You allowed cloud fallback in Settings |
|                                          |
| Data Sent:                               |
| • Your query: "How's my budget?"         |
| • Anonymized budget summary              |
| • NO raw transaction data                |
| • NO personally identifiable information |
|                                          |
| Privacy Protection:                      |
| • Privacy Proxy filtered PII             |
| • Data NOT stored by OpenAI              |
| • Connection encrypted (HTTPS)           |
|                                          |
| 💡 To always use local processing:      |
|    Settings → LLM → Disable cloud fallback|

### Privacy Proxy Visualization

**When PII is filtered before cloud LLM:**

```

| (PII Filtered)   [Why?]        |  ← Shows PII was filtered
|                                |
| Your expense at Store Name     |
| was 45.99 EUR.                 |

### Just-in-Time Permission Requests

**NEVER ask for permissions upfront. Ask when needed.**

**Example: Calendar Access**

**Context:**
- User: "Do I have meetings tomorrow?"
- Calendar supervisor needs Google Calendar access
- User has never granted this permission

**LLM Renders: Permission Request Modal**

```

|                                          |
