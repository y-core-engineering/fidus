# Contextual UI Patterns

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** Draft (Awaiting Human Review)
**Part of:** Fidus UX/UI Design
**Author:** AI-Generated

---

## Overview

This document shows **situational UI patterns** for Fidus's 14 bounded contexts.

**CRITICAL:** These are NOT "fixed screens." They are EXAMPLES of how the LLM MIGHT render UI based on context.

**Foundation:** [AI-Driven UI Paradigm](00-ai-driven-ui-paradigm.md)

---

## Important: Not Fixed Screens!

    style Traditional fill:#e57373
    style Fidus fill:#81c784
```

**This document shows:**
- "In situation X, LLM MIGHT render Y"
- Alternative contexts → different UI responses
- Example dialogues → UI outcomes

**This document does NOT show:**
- "Calendar Screen always looks like this"
- "User navigates to Finance → sees this"
- Hardcoded flows

---

## Core Domains

### 1. Orchestration Domain (🎯)

**Purpose:** Intent detection and routing to appropriate supervisors

**User RARELY interacts directly** with Orchestration - it works behind the scenes.

#### Situational Pattern: Intent Unclear

**Context:**
- User query: "Fix it"
- Ambiguous intent
- Orchestrator cannot determine which supervisor to route to

**LLM Renders: Clarification Dialog**

```
+--------------------------------+
| User                           |
| Fix it                         |
+--------------------------------+

+--------------------------------+
| Fidus              🔒 Local    |
|                                |
| I'm not sure what to fix.      |
| Could you clarify?             |
|                                |
| Did you mean:                  |
| • Fix calendar conflict?       |
| • Fix budget issue?            |
| • Fix something else?          |
+--------------------------------+
```

---

#### Situational Pattern: Supervisor Fallback

**Context:**
- Finance supervisor's LLM offline
- User asks budget question
- Orchestrator detects failure

**LLM Renders: Fallback Notice**

```
+--------------------------------+
| Fidus              ⚠️ Cloud    |
|                                |
| Budget information requested.  |
|                                |
| Local LLM temporarily          |
| unavailable. I'm using cloud   |
| processing (OpenAI).           |
|                                |
| ☁️ Your query (not raw data)   |
|    was sent to cloud.          |

|                                |
| [Why?] Learn about fallback    |
+--------------------------------+
```

---

### 2. Proactivity Domain (💡)

**Purpose:** Opportunity detection and surfacing

#### Situational Pattern: High-Relevance Opportunity

**Context:**
- Meeting in 30 minutes
- No alarm set
- Traffic delay detected
- Relevance: 0.95 (very high)

**LLM Renders: Urgent Proactive Card**

```
+------------------------------------------+
| ⚠️ URGENT                  🔒 Local    ✕ |
+------------------------------------------+
| Meeting starting soon                    |
|                                          |
| Client Call - 2:00 PM (30 min away)      |
| Office location (5km drive)              |
|                                          |
| ⚠️ No alarm set                          |
| 🚗 Traffic delay: +15 minutes            |
|                                          |
| 💡 Leave now to arrive on time          |
+------------------------------------------+
| [Set Alarm & Navigate]  [Reschedule]     |
+------------------------------------------+
```

---

#### Situational Pattern: Insight (Low Action Needed)

**Context:**
- User spent 20% less on food this month
- Not urgent, just interesting
- Relevance: 0.55 (medium)

**LLM Renders: Insight Card (Dashboard Only, No Push)**

```
+------------------------------------------+
| 💡 Spending Insight        🔒 Local    ✕ |
+------------------------------------------+
| Food spending down 20% this month        |
|                                          |
| Oct: 400 EUR vs Sep: 500 EUR            |
| You saved 100 EUR!                       |
|                                          |
| 💡 Keep it up! On track to save 1200    |
|    EUR annually at this rate.            |

**Note:** This appears on dashboard only. NO push notification (not urgent enough).

## Alternative Context Examples

### Same Query, Different Contexts

**Query: "Create a budget"**

**Context 1: First-Time User**
→ LLM renders: Wizard with guidance and examples

**Context 2: Experienced User**
→ LLM renders: Quick form with smart defaults

**Context 3: User Uncertain**
→ LLM renders: Conversational clarification first

---

**Query: "What's my schedule?"**

**Context 1: Simple Day (2 events)**
→ LLM renders: Text response

**Context 2: Busy Day (5+ events)**
→ LLM renders: Text + Calendar widget

**Context 3: Multi-Day Query**
→ LLM renders: Week view widget

---

## Key Takeaways

### For Designers

**Do:**
- ✅ Show EXAMPLES of situational rendering
- ✅ Demonstrate FLEXIBILITY in UI responses
- ✅ Emphasize LLM DECISION-MAKING
- ✅ Include ALTERNATIVE contexts

**Don't:**
- ❌ Design "fixed screens"
- ❌ Say "always shows X"
- ❌ Hardcode UI flows
- ❌ Assume predetermined navigation

---

### For Developers

**Implement:**
- Context-adaptive rendering engine
- LLM prompt-based UI decisions
- Component library (not page templates)
- Real-time context evaluation

**Not:**
- Fixed route → fixed screen mappings
- Hardcoded "if time = morning, show weather"
- Predetermined UI flows
