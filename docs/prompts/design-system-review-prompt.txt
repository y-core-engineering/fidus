DESIGN SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW PROMPT
==========================================

ROLE: UX/UI Expert & Design System Specialist

CONTEXT: You are reviewing the Fidus Design System implementation against the original concept document.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YOUR TASK

Review the implementation of the Fidus Design System (located in packages/design-system/) and compare it against the concept defined in docs/ux-ui-design/18-design-system-website.md.

Focus on three key areas:

===============================================================================
1. NAVIGATION HIERARCHY REVIEW
===============================================================================

REFERENCE: Section 3 "Website Structure" > "Navigation Hierarchy" in 18-design-system-website.md

COMPARE:
- Read the complete navigation structure defined in the concept (lines 69-184)
- Inspect the actual implementation in packages/design-system/components/navigation/sidebar.tsx
- Check all navigation items and their organization

EVALUATE:
- Does the navigation match the concept's hierarchy?
- Are all top-level sections present? (Home, Getting Started, Foundations, Components, Patterns, Tokens, Architecture, Content Guidelines, Resources)
- Are subsections correctly nested and categorized?
- Are unique Fidus features marked appropriately? (AI-Driven UI, Opportunity Card, Privacy & Trust, Architecture sections)
- What is missing or incorrectly organized?
- What is present but not in the concept?

OUTPUT FORMAT:

1. Navigation Hierarchy Review

  MATCHES CONCEPT:
  - [List sections that correctly match]

  DEVIATIONS FROM CONCEPT:
  - [List sections that don't match or are missing]

  ADDITIONAL ITEMS (not in concept):
  - [List items present in implementation but not in concept]

  COMPLETENESS SCORE: X/Y sections (Z%)

===============================================================================
2. CONTENT ORGANIZATION REVIEW
===============================================================================

REFERENCE: Section 4 "Content Organization" in 18-design-system-website.md

COMPARE:
- Read the page structure template (lines 190-227)
- Read the example Button component page (lines 229-345)
- Inspect actual component pages in packages/design-system/app/components/
- Inspect pattern pages in packages/design-system/app/patterns/
- Inspect foundation pages in packages/design-system/app/foundations/

EVALUATE FOR EACH MAJOR CONTENT TYPE (sample 5 components, 3 patterns, 3 foundations):

REQUIRED PAGE STRUCTURE ELEMENTS:
1. Brief description (1-2 sentences)
2. Interactive Preview / Visual Examples
3. "When to Use" section (with "Use when..." and "Don't use when...")
4. Variants (visual examples)
5. Props API table (if component)
6. Code Examples (React/TypeScript)
7. Accessibility section (WCAG compliance, keyboard nav, screen reader)
8. Do's and Don'ts (side-by-side visual examples)
9. Related Components/Patterns
10. Resources (Figma link, GitHub link)

OUTPUT FORMAT:

2. Content Organization Review

  COMPONENT PAGES (Sample: Button, Modal, Toast, Opportunity Card, Text Input)

  PATTERN PAGES (Sample: Onboarding, Search & Filtering, Settings)
  [Same structure as components, adapted for patterns]

  FOUNDATION PAGES (Sample: AI-Driven UI, Privacy & Trust, Colors)
  [Same structure as components, adapted for foundations]

  OVERALL CONTENT ORGANIZATION SCORE:
  - Components: X% complete (average across samples)
  - Patterns: X% complete
  - Foundations: X% complete
  - OVERALL: X% complete

===============================================================================
3. KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVIEW EXECUTION
===============================================================================

1. START WITH NAVIGATION: Begin by reviewing packages/design-system/components/navigation/sidebar.tsx

2. SAMPLE CONTENT: Don't review every single page - use representative samples

3. BE SPECIFIC: Reference exact file paths and line numbers when citing issues

4. BE CONSTRUCTIVE: Provide specific, actionable feedback

5. NOTE WHAT'S GOOD: Highlight implementations that exceed the concept

6. CONSIDER CONTEXT: The design system is actively being built - some features may be intentionally deferred

7. CHECK LIVE SITE: If possible, run the dev server (cd packages/design-system && pnpm dev) to test interactive features

===============================================================================
OUTPUT FORMAT
===============================================================================

Provide your review as a structured document with:
- Clear headings and sections
- YES/NO indicators for visual clarity
- Percentage scores for quantitative assessment
- Specific examples and file references
- Actionable recommendations

ESTIMATED REVIEW TIME: 30-45 minutes for thorough analysis

===============================================================================

READY TO BEGIN? Start with the navigation hierarchy review, then move to content organization, and finish with key features.
