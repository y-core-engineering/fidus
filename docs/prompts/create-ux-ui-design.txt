CRITICAL PARADIGM SHIFT: AI-DRIVEN UI (READ THIS FIRST!)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Fidus uses an **AI-DRIVEN UI PARADIGM** that is fundamentally different from traditional application UI design.

**WRONG APPROACH (Traditional UI):**
❌ Fixed screens (Dashboard Screen, Calendar Screen, Finance Screen)
❌ Static navigation (Sidebar with menu items)
❌ Hardcoded UI flows ("User clicks X → System shows Y")
❌ Predetermined layouts ("Morning always shows weather widget")
❌ User navigates to features

**CORRECT APPROACH (AI-Driven UI):**
✅ **Context-Driven UI Rendering** - LLM analyzes situation and decides optimal UI
✅ **Dashboard as Opportunity Surface** - Dynamic cards based on relevance, NOT static widgets
✅ **Situational Adaptation** - Same query can render differently based on context
✅ **User-Controlled Dismissal** - User swipes/clicks X to dismiss (NO auto-hide timers)
✅ **Nothing Predetermined** - Design shows EXAMPLES not RULES
✅ **LLM Chooses UI Form** - Chat vs. Form vs. Widget decided at runtime by LLM

CORE PRINCIPLES:

1. **LLM as UI Decision Engine**
   - LLM decides whether to show chat response, form, widget, or wizard
   - Same user query can produce different UI based on context
   - Example: "Create budget" → form for power user, wizard for beginner
   - NO hardcoded "if X then show Y" in design

2. **Dashboard = Opportunity Surface**
   - Dashboard shows DYNAMIC opportunity cards (NOT static widgets)
   - Content changes based on: time, location, user history, supervisor signals
   - User can open dashboard anytime (swipe down or button)
   - Example: Morning might show weather + meetings, evening might show day summary
   - But we don't HARDCODE "morning = weather" - LLM decides relevance

3. **User Controls Visibility**
   - Cards dismissed by user action: swipe gesture or X button
   - NO automatic hiding after timeout
   - Cards remain visible until user explicitly dismisses
   - Dashboard always accessible (not hidden by system)

4. **Examples, Not Rules**
   - Design document shows: "In situation X, system MIGHT show Y"
   - NOT: "When X happens, system ALWAYS shows Y"
   - Emphasize flexibility and LLM decision-making
   - Use language like: "could show", "might render", "based on context"

5. **Form vs. Chat: LLM Decides**
   - Don't predetermine "Budget creation uses form"
   - LLM analyzes: Is structured input more efficient than chat?
   - Factors: User expertise, number of parameters, ambiguity
   - Example: Simple query → chat, complex multi-param → form

BEFORE YOU START DESIGNING:
1. Read: docs/ux-ui-design/00-ai-driven-ui-paradigm.md (if exists - THE FOUNDATION)
2. Internalize: UI is a FUNCTION of CONTEXT, decided by LLM at runtime
3. Avoid: Any design that implies fixed screens or predetermined flows
4. Emphasize: Flexibility, adaptation, contextual rendering

UX/UI DESIGN TO CREATE

Content Requirements:

The UX/UI design must cover:

1. Design Philosophy & Principles
   - How privacy-first affects UX (transparency, control, local-first)
   - How LLM-driven logic affects UI (conversational, adaptive, smart defaults)
   - How proactivity is presented (non-intrusive, contextual, dismissible)
   - Accessibility principles (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
   - Design language (must align with brand identity: modern, clean, trustworthy)
   - Brand personality in UX (from fidus-brand-identity-en.md)

2. User Personas & Journeys
   - Primary personas (individual users, families, power users)
   - Key user journeys mapped to Bounded Contexts
   - Pain points and how Fidus solves them
   - User goals and success metrics

3. Information Architecture (CONTEXTUAL, NOT FIXED)
   - Contextual layers (NOT fixed hierarchy)
     * Layer 1: Opportunity Surface (dashboard - always accessible)
     * Layer 2: Conversational Interface (chat/voice - primary)
     * Layer 3: Situational UI (forms/widgets appear when LLM decides)
     * Layer 4: Settings (rarely accessed)
   - How 14 Bounded Contexts appear situationally in UI
   - Dashboard access patterns (swipe down, button)
   - Settings and configuration structure
   - Tenant/workspace switching (for Family/Team/Company tiers)

4. Core Interaction Patterns
   - Conversational UI (chat interface, voice commands)
   - Natural language input (how users express intent)
   - CRITICAL: Situational/Contextual UI (dynamic interfaces based on conversation)
     - Chat triggers domain-specific UIs (e.g., "check my calendar" opens calendar widget)
     - Rich UI cards embedded in chat (interactive forms, data visualizations)
     - Adaptive interfaces that appear/disappear based on context
     - Example: Budget discussion shows inline budget chart, meeting planning shows calendar picker
   - Proactive notifications (timing, presentation, dismissal)
   - Multi-step workflows (e.g., calendar scheduling, trip planning)
   - Implicit learning feedback (how system learns from user behavior)
   - Permission requests (transparent, granular, just-in-time)

5. Component Library & Design System
   - Typography scale (must align with brand identity!)
   - Color palette (primary, secondary, semantic - from brand identity)
   - Spacing system
   - Component catalog (buttons, cards, forms, modals, etc.)
   - Icon set (brand-consistent)
   - Animation principles (purposeful, not decorative)
   - Logo usage guidelines
   - Tone of voice in UI text (friendly, trustworthy, professional)

6. Contextual UI Patterns (NOT Fixed Screens!)
   CRITICAL: These are EXAMPLES of situational rendering, NOT hardcoded screens!
   - Dashboard as Opportunity Surface (shows relevant cards based on context)
   - Chat/Voice Interface (primary interaction)
   - Situational widgets for each domain (Calendar, Finance, Travel, etc.)
     * Show: "In context X, LLM might render Y"
     * NOT: "Calendar Screen looks like this"
   - Dynamic forms (when LLM decides structured input is better)
   - Multi-step wizards (for complex flows)
   - Settings (privacy controls, preferences, integrations)
   - Onboarding Flow (first-time user experience - CRITICAL!)
   - Permission Management (Service/Data/LLM permissions granular control)
   - Plugin Marketplace (community extensions discovery/installation)
   - LLM Model Selection (Ollama local vs. Cloud LLM choice)
   - Shared Resources (Family calendar, shared shopping lists)

   For each domain, show:
   - Example context → LLM decision → UI rendered
   - Alternative contexts → different UI
   - Emphasize: FLEXIBILITY and ADAPTATION

7. Responsive Design & Progressive Web App (PWA)
   - Desktop (primary interface - 1024px+)
   - Tablet (768px - 1023px)
   - Mobile Web (320px - 767px, responsive breakpoints)
   - PWA (Progressive Web App - CRITICAL!)
     - Offline capability (Service Workers for core functionality)
     - Install to home screen (manifest.json, app icons)
     - Native-like experience (full-screen, splash screen)
     - Push notifications (proactive suggestions)
     - Background sync (when connection restored)
     - App shell architecture (instant loading)
   - Native Mobile Apps (iOS, Android - optional for Cloud/Enterprise)
   - CLI (command-line interface design for power users)

8. Privacy & Trust UX
   - Privacy indicators (local vs. cloud processing)
   - Data usage transparency (what data, why, when)
   - Permission UI (Service/Data/LLM permissions - granular, clear, revocable)
   - Audit log access (user sees what system did - EU AI Act compliance)
   - Onboarding trust-building (explaining privacy model)
   - Privacy Proxy visualization (show when PII is filtered before cloud LLM)
   - Encryption indicators (show when data is encrypted at rest)
   - Community vs. Cloud vs. Enterprise privacy differences

9. AI/LLM-Specific UX
   - "Thinking" indicators (when LLM is processing)
   - Confidence visualization (how certain is the AI?)
   - Explanation UI (why did Fidus suggest this? - EU AI Act transparency)
   - Fallback UI (when AI fails, graceful degradation to rule-based routing)
   - Model selection (Ollama local vs. Cloud LLM - user choice)
   - LLM-driven vs. rule-based indication (show when system switches to fallback mode)

10. Proactivity UX
    - Opportunity Cards on Dashboard (NOT notifications)
    - Card types: Urgent, Time-Sensitive, Optimization, Insight
    - User dismissal: Swipe gesture or X button (NO auto-hide)
    - Dashboard always accessible (swipe down/button)
    - Feedback mechanisms (was this helpful?)
    - Do Not Disturb modes (affects card relevance scoring)

11. Multi-User / Family / Team / Company UX (Multi-Tenancy)
    - Tenant/workspace switching (Individual -> Family -> Team -> Company)
    - Shared resources UI (Family calendar, shared shopping lists, team budgets)
    - Privacy boundaries (what's shared, what's private)
    - Access control visualization (who can see/edit what)
    - Permission hierarchies (owner/admin/member/viewer roles)
    - Shared resource notifications (who added/changed what)
    - Onboarding new family/team members

12. Accessibility
    - Keyboard navigation
    - Screen reader support
    - Color contrast (WCAG AA)
    - Font sizes and readability
    - Alternative text for images/icons
    - Focus indicators

13. Terminology & Ubiquitous Language in UI (CRITICAL!)
    - Use terms from docs/domain-model/01-ubiquitous-language.md consistently
    - "Supervisor" (not "Agent" or "Bot") for domain assistants
    - "Bounded Context" awareness (users understand different domains)
    - "Signals" and "Proactive Suggestions" (not "Notifications")
    - "Appointment" (not "Event" - avoid ambiguity)
    - "Permission" categories: Service, Data, LLM
    - Anti-patterns to avoid (e.g., "Chatbot", "Task", "Request")

14. Deployment Edition Differences
    - Community Edition (Self-Hosted):
      - Local-only UI elements
      - Hardware requirement warnings
      - No cloud sync options
      - PWA install encouraged (no app store needed)
      - Offline-first experience
    - Cloud Edition (Managed):
      - Cloud sync indicators
      - PWA with online/offline hybrid mode
      - Optional native mobile apps (iOS, Android)
      - Subscription management UI
    - Enterprise Edition (Hybrid):
      - SSO integration UI
      - Admin dashboards
      - Multi-tenant management
      - Air-gapped mode indicators
      - Custom PWA deployment on intranet

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

UX Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

MUST reflect:
- Privacy by Design (users MUST see what's happening with their data)
- LLM-Driven Logic (UI adapts to AI decisions, not hard-coded flows)
- Proactivity (non-intrusive, user retains control)
- Implicit Learning (system learns without explicit user training)
- Multi-Tenancy (family/team/company contexts clear and switchable)
- Ubiquitous Language (use terms from domain model consistently)
- Bounded Context awareness (14 supervisors, each with clear purpose)
- MCP-based extensibility (plugin marketplace, community extensions)
- Graceful degradation (clear UI when LLM fails, fallback to rules)

MUST NOT:
- Dark patterns (manipulation, deception)
- Hidden data collection (always transparent)
- Forced cloud usage (local must be default for Community Edition)
- Overwhelming proactivity (respect user attention, >50% acceptance rate target)
- Inaccessible interfaces (WCAG AA minimum)
- Inconsistent terminology (always use ubiquitous language)
- Hidden permission usage (always show Service/Data/LLM permissions)

Design Requirements:
- Load Time: Perceived < 1 second (use optimistic UI, skeletons, app shell)
- Mobile-First: Responsive down to 320px width
- PWA-Ready: Offline capability, install to home screen, native-like experience
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Privacy: Visual indicators for local vs. cloud processing
- Trust: Always show why and how Fidus does things

APPROACH

Step 1: Understand the System (CRITICAL!)
- Read ALL specified documents completely
- Understand the 13 Core Principles and their UX implications
- Read and internalize the brand identity (visual language, tone, personality)
- Map Bounded Contexts to user mental models
- Identify key user workflows

Step 2: Research & Benchmarking
- Review similar systems (personal AI assistants, productivity tools)
- Note what works and what doesn't
- Identify UX patterns for LLM-based interfaces
- Consider privacy-focused apps (Signal, ProtonMail)

Step 3: Clarification & Questions
- DO NOT HALLUCINATE!
- For uncertainties: ASK
- Ask specifically:
  - "How should users switch between local and cloud LLM?"
  - "What level of detail should permission requests show (Service/Data/LLM)?"
  - "How intrusive can proactive notifications be?"
  - "Should chat be the primary interface or one of many?"
  - "How do users switch between Personal/Family/Team/Company tenants?"
  - "How is the Privacy Proxy (PII filtering) visualized to users?"
  - "What happens when LLM fails? How is fallback mode shown?"
  - "How do users discover and install plugins from marketplace?"
  - "How are Supervisors (Bounded Contexts) presented in UI?"
  - "Should onboarding be mandatory or skippable?"

Step 4: Structure the UX/UI Design
- IMPORTANT: Decide how to split the design into multiple self-contained documents
- Each document should cover a specific aspect of the design
- Create a logical structure (e.g., principles, personas, IA, patterns, screens, components)
- Create a README.md for navigation

Step 5: Create UX/UI Design
- Write structured according to your chosen document structure
- Use wireframes/mockups (describe in detail or use ASCII art placeholders)
- Include Mermaid diagrams for user flows
- Show design rationale for EVERY decision
- Include multiple design alternatives where relevant

Step 6: Review Preparation
- Create a checklist:
  - All 13 Core Principles reflected in UX?
  - All 14 Bounded Contexts (Supervisors) have UI representations?
  - Brand identity consistently applied (colors, typography, tone)?
  - Privacy & trust UX complete (Privacy Proxy, encryption, permissions)?
  - Accessibility considered (WCAG 2.1 AA)?
  - Responsive design addressed (desktop, tablet, mobile)?
  - PWA requirements covered (offline, install, push notifications)?
  - Multi-tenancy UX complete (Personal/Family/Team/Company)?
  - Ubiquitous language used consistently in all UI text?
  - Onboarding flow designed and documented?
  - Plugin marketplace and MCP extensibility shown?
  - Graceful degradation (LLM fallback) designed?
  - Deployment edition differences addressed (Community/Cloud/Enterprise)?
  - Situational/Contextual UI examples provided?

REVIEWER NOTES

This UX/UI design will be reviewed by a human designer/architect. Therefore:

1. Rationale: EVERY design decision must be justified
2. Alternatives: Show multiple design options with pros/cons
3. Accessibility: Always mention WCAG compliance
4. Privacy: Explicitly show privacy/trust UX elements
5. User Flows: Use Mermaid to visualize journeys
6. Modular Structure: Each document independently reviewable

EXAMPLE OF GOOD DESIGN DECISION

Design Decision: Notification Presentation

Chosen: Slide-in drawer (bottom-right corner)

Alternatives:
- Toast notifications (too intrusive, hard to dismiss)
- Email-style inbox (requires user to check, defeats proactivity)
- Modal dialogs (blocking, annoying)

Rationale:
- Non-blocking (user can continue working)
- Dismissible (user in control)
- Stackable (multiple notifications possible)
- Respects Do Not Disturb mode
- Matches Core Principle 3 (Event-Driven Proactivity, non-intrusive)

Accessibility:
- Keyboard accessible (Tab + Enter to open/dismiss)
- Screen reader announces new notifications
- Focus management (returns to previous focus after dismissal)
- Color-coded by urgency (visual + semantic)

Privacy:
- No preview of sensitive data (until user opens)
- Clear source indication (which Supervisor sent this?)

User Research:
- Similar pattern used in Slack, Microsoft Teams (familiar)
- User testing showed 85% preference over modals

Open Question:
- Should notifications auto-dismiss after X seconds? (might miss important info)

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE GUIDELINES

When deciding how to split the UX/UI design:

Consider splitting by:
- Design phase (principles, research, IA, patterns, components)
- User journey (onboarding, daily use, power user features)
- Platform (web, mobile, CLI)
- Feature domain (chat, calendar, finance, etc.)
- Design concern (accessibility, privacy UX, responsive design)

Each document should:
- Have a clear, single focus
- Be readable independently (but may reference other docs)
- Include relevant wireframes/mockups (described in detail)
- Show design rationale
- Reference source architecture/domain documents
- Be approximately 500-2000 lines (adjust as needed)

Example structure (but you decide!):
- README.md (navigation and overview)
- Design philosophy and principles
- User personas and journeys
- Information architecture
- Core interaction patterns
- Design system and components
- Key screens and flows (multiple documents if needed)
- Responsive design & PWA
- Privacy and trust UX
- AI/LLM-specific UX
- Multi-tenancy UX
- Accessibility guidelines
- Appendices (design decisions, open questions, checklist)

WIREFRAME/MOCKUP GUIDELINES

CRITICAL: ALL diagrams, wireframes, and visual representations MUST use Mermaid format!

According to docs/CLAUDE.md: "Use Mermaid diagrams - All architecture, flows, and relationships must be visualized using Mermaid in markdown files."

Mermaid Diagram Types for UX/UI:

1. User Flows: Use flowchart or graph
Example:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[User opens app] --> Auth{Authenticated?}
    Auth -->|No| Login[Show login screen]
    Auth -->|Yes| Dashboard[Show dashboard]
    Login --> Auth
    Dashboard --> Action{User action}
    Action -->|Chat| Chat[Open chat interface]
    Action -->|Calendar| Cal[Open calendar view]
    Action -->|Settings| Settings[Open settings]
```

2. Screen Layouts: Use graph with subgraphs
Example:
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph DashboardScreen["Dashboard Screen"]
        subgraph TopBar["Top Bar"]
            Logo[Fidus Logo]
            Search[Search Input]
            Profile[Profile Avatar]
            Notifications[Bell Icon]
            Settings[Gear Icon]
        end

        subgraph Sidebar["Sidebar (240px)"]
            NavCal[Calendar]
            NavFin[Finance]
            NavTravel[Travel]
            NavMore[More...]
        end

        subgraph MainContent["Main Content Area"]
            Greeting[Good morning, User!]

            subgraph ProactiveCard["Proactive Insights"]
                Insight1[Budget alert: Food 90%]
                Insight2[Meeting conflict tomorrow]
                Insight3[Travel reminder: Paris]
            end

            subgraph QuickActions["Quick Actions Grid"]
                Action1[New Event]
                Action2[Check Budget]
                Action3[Plan Trip]
                Action4[Send Message]
            end

            subgraph RecentActivity["Recent Activity"]
                Activity1[2h ago: Email reply]
                Activity2[3h ago: Calendar update]
            end
        end

        ChatWidget[Chat Widget - Minimized]
    end
```

3. Component States: Use stateDiagram
Example:
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle: Component loads
    Idle --> Loading: User clicks button
    Loading --> Success: Data received
    Loading --> Error: Request failed
    Success --> Idle: User navigates away
    Error --> Idle: User dismisses error
    Error --> Loading: User retries
```

4. Navigation Hierarchy: Use graph TD
Example:
```mermaid
graph TD
    App[Fidus App]

    App --> Dashboard
    App --> Chat
    App --> Settings

    Dashboard --> Calendar
    Dashboard --> Finance
    Dashboard --> Travel

    Calendar --> DayView[Day View]
    Calendar --> WeekView[Week View]
    Calendar --> MonthView[Month View]

    Settings --> Privacy
    Settings --> Integrations
    Settings --> Appearance
```

5. Interaction Sequences: Use sequenceDiagram
Example:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant UI as UI Layer
    participant Orch as Orchestrator
    participant Cal as Calendar Supervisor

    User->>UI: "Schedule meeting tomorrow at 2pm"
    UI->>Orch: Parse intent
    Orch->>Cal: Find free slots
    Cal-->>Orch: Available slots
    Orch->>UI: Show suggestions
    UI->>User: "2pm or 3pm available?"
    User->>UI: Select 2pm
    UI->>Cal: Create appointment
    Cal-->>UI: Confirmation
    UI->>User: "Meeting scheduled!"
```

NO ASCII ART! NO text-only descriptions for visual layouts! ALWAYS use Mermaid!

Detailed text descriptions are allowed ONLY for:
- Design rationale and explanations
- Color specifications (e.g., "Primary: #1976D2")
- Typography details (e.g., "H1: 32px, Bold, Inter")
- Spacing/sizing values (e.g., "Card padding: 16px")
- Interaction micro-behaviors (e.g., "Button hover: lift 2px, shadow grows")

SITUATIONAL/CONTEXTUAL UI EXAMPLES (CRITICAL!)

Must show how chat triggers context-specific interfaces:

Example 1: Budget Discussion
User: "How much have I spent on food this month?"
Fidus: "You've spent 450 EUR on food (90% of budget)."
[Inline UI appears in chat]:
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph BudgetCard["Budget Card - Food Category"]
        Chart[Progress Bar: 90% filled]
        Details[450 EUR / 500 EUR]
        Actions[View Transactions | Adjust Budget]
    end
```

Example 2: Calendar Scheduling
User: "Schedule a meeting with John next week"
Fidus: "When works best for you?"
[Calendar picker appears in chat]:
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph CalendarWidget["Week View - Inline"]
        Mon[Monday: 2pm, 4pm available]
        Tue[Tuesday: 10am, 3pm available]
        Wed[Wednesday: Full]
        SelectButton[Select Time Slot]
    end
```

Example 3: Travel Planning
User: "Plan my trip to Paris"
Fidus: "I found your flight. Need a hotel?"
[Travel card appears in chat]:
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph TravelCard["Trip Card"]
        Flight[Flight: 10 Nov, 2pm]
        Hotel[Suggested Hotels: 3 options]
        Actions[Book Hotel | Add to Calendar | Set Reminders]
    end
```

These situational UIs must:
- Appear contextually (triggered by conversation, not always visible)
- Be dismissible (user can close and continue chat)
- Be interactive (user can act directly in the widget)
- Be domain-specific (Finance UI looks different from Calendar UI)
- Transition smoothly (fade in/out, no jarring appearance)

PRIVACY UX EXAMPLES TO INCLUDE

Must show how privacy manifests in UI:

1. Local vs. Cloud Indicator:
   - Visual badge on LLM responses ("Processed locally" vs. "Processed via OpenAI")
   - User can click to see details (why cloud was used, what data was sent)

2. Permission Requests:
   - Just-in-time (when Fidus needs access, not upfront)
   - Clear purpose ("Fidus needs Google Calendar access to find free slots")
   - Granular (not "access everything", but "read calendar events only")
   - Revocable (easy to revoke in settings)

3. Audit Log:
   - User-accessible log of all Fidus actions
